If you're the type of person that prefers to use a mouse as little as possible, you may want to give this a shot. It's my first experiment with Chrome extensions. I'm using an Ubuntu netbook and was annoyed by not being able to change pages from fullscreen mode like the rest of you. 

Just use CTRL+L from fullscreen mode to show the address bar, and ESC or the ~ key to hide it.

You can download it and load it from chrome://extensions as long as you're using the 'dev' channel version of Chrome. I'll be sure to put a packaged version of this up sometime soon, but from what I've heard, an update to Chrome will solve this problem anyway, so this is just something for the meantime.
